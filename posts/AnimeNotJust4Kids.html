                    <h3>What is Anime?</h3>
                    <p>Anime is most commonly used to refer to the animations produced by the Japanese animation industry.</p>
                    <h3>Why anime should not be considered as <q>Only for kids</q>?</h3>
                    <p>Anime, is usually put under the category of kids, because it's considered to be the same as cartoons like <q>The Mask</q> or <q>The Scooby-Doo show</q>. Though, I personally believe even adults should enjoy cartoons, because:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are funny and help relieve stress</li>
                            <li>They have really good stories</li>
                            <li>They may help keep the kid inside you <em>alive</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without digressing from the topic, the reason why anime should not be considered only for kids is because:
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are animes which are created for adults</li>
                            <li>Blanket sweeping animes as <q>for kids</q> will result in the adults missing out on some really amazing stories and artwork.</li>
                            <li>It may help you broaden your imaginations.</li>
                            <li>I can keep going but, I believe it's better if you give it a try, starting with a few of my favourites:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Inuyasha series(Part 1 and 2)</li>
                                    <li>Black Butler(Part 1)</li>
                                    <li>Irregular at Magic Highschool</li>
                                    <li>Naruto, Ippo, One Piece, One Punch Man, ..... to Infinity and Beyond</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

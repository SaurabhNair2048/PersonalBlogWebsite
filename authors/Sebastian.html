                <p>Hello. I'm the author of atleast one of the posts on this website, and  hopefully many more to come. Name's <em>Sebastian</em> as is displayed above. I do not have any titles as of now, except <q>Champion of Warlords Battlecry</q>. I am currently a freelance blogger and trying to find my place. I have a degree in Computer Science. I love animes with a story and where the characters connect on a level that is believable. I also like playiing games a lot and reading about the theories about some ongoing animes. I hope someday I will make a living out of enjoying animes :)</p>
                <p>Well, that's all folks... Below is a couple of images related to my favourite animes from the web. You can check out more online.</p>
